# Install Instructions

Make sure you have Ruby installed. (Google 'install Ruby' for this.) Once Ruby is installed, in any command prompt type 'gem install gosu' if you don't have Gosu.

Inside of the game directory, run 'ruby main.rb'.

## Todo list

### Priority

* Data driven animation system with state machines
* Level design
* Gameplay mechanics
* Build GUIs off of data

### Less important

* GUI Stack (done, but could use some cleanup)
* Camera movement (done, but transformations not yet universal (?))
* Scene graph

* quadtree not working
