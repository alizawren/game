# Install Instructions

Make sure you have Ruby installed. (Google 'install Ruby' for this.) Once Ruby is installed, in any command prompt type 'gem install gosu' if you don't have Gosu.

Inside of the game directory, run 'ruby main.rb'.

## Todo list

- GUI Stack (done, but could use some cleanup)
- Camera movement
- Scene graph
- collision response
- quadtree not working
- ideally want to place x and y at center of objects (or store center)? to detect proximity, at least (actually this whole thing is a matter of bounding rectangles)
